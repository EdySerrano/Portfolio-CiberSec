# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this assessment is to safeguard the organization’s database server, which serves as a critical repository for sensitive client data and proprietary business intelligence. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this server is vital for maintaining customer trust and operational continuity. A successful breach or prolonged downtime would result in significant financial loss and legal liability. By identifying potential vulnerabilities now, we can proactively align our technical security posture with the company's broader mission of data privacy and reliability.

## 2. Risk Assessment
The following table identifies potential threats and evaluates them based on a qualitative scale of 1 (Low) to 3 (High).


| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk Score ($L \times S$) |
|-----|--------|------|------|------|
|**Adversarial:** External Cyber Criminal | SQL Injection resulting in the exfiltration of sensitive customer data.|3|3|9|
|**Adversarial:** Malicious Insider | Unauthorized access to database tables to alter financial records. |2|3|6|
|**Non-Adversarial:** System Failure | Database corruption or hardware failure leading to loss of availability. |2|2|4|

**Risk Calculation:** The Risk Score is determined by the formula $Likelihood \times Severity = Risk$. A score of 9 represents a critical priority.

## 3. Approach

This qualitative vulnerability assessment relies on expert judgment to prioritize threats that pose the most significant risk to business operations. I selected external cyber-attacks, insider threats, and system failures because they represent the most likely vectors for data loss or service disruption in a database environment. Each event was evaluated based on industry trends and the server's specific role in the organization. By focusing on these high-impact areas, we ensure that resources are allocated where they can most effectively reduce overall organizational risk.

## 4. Remediation Strategy

To mitigate the identified risks, we recommend implementing a multi-layered **defense-in-depth** strategy centered on the **principle of least privilege**. Deploying **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and the **AAA framework (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)** will strictly control and log administrative access, reducing the impact of both external and insider threats. Additionally, we should utilize data encryption at rest and in transit to maintain confidentiality even in the event of a breach. Regular automated backups and hardware redundancy protocols will further ensure the availability of the system against unforeseen failures.
